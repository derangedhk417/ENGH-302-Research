# ENGH-302-Research

This repository contains a Python script written to assist in research for my ENGH-302 Literature Review paper. In order to properly support my hypothesis, I needed to define the properties that make a supercapacitor commercially viable. I could not find a clear definition on the internet that was backed up my recent market trends. This script analyzes CSV files obtained by downloading the Digi-Key listing of Supercapacitors. Digi-Key is one of the largest electronics distributors in North America. At the momen they have 1336 supercapacitors listed for sale on their website. This script pulls the relevent information out of those listings and computes statistics about them. The resulting information is used to support my argument in the aforementioned paper.
